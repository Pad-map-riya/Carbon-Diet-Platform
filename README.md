Project overview

CarbonQuest is a gamified sustainability platform that turns eco-friendly habits into a fun community competition. Users join teams (like neighborhoods or schools), log daily green actions—like taking public transport or reducing water use—and earn "Green Credits." These points fuel team leaderboards and can be redeemed for real rewards from local businesses. The app includes daily challenges, progress tracking, and QR-based reward claims. By combining social motivation, friendly competition, and real-world impact, CarbonQuest makes living sustainably fun, rewarding, and community-driven
